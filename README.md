# Walmart_Sales_Analysis


## Overview

This project aims to analyze Walmart's sales data to identify top-performing branches and products, explore sales trends, and understand customer behavior. The goal is to provide insights that can help improve and optimize sales strategies. The dataset used in this analysis is from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting).

In this competition, participants are given historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores across different regions. Each store contains various departments, and the challenge is to predict sales for each department. Holiday markdown events, which are known to affect sales, add complexity to the predictions as participants must determine which departments are impacted and to what extent.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to analyze Walmartâ€™s sales data to identify the factors that influence sales across different branches.

## Data Description

The dataset was sourced from the [Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/walmart-recruiting-store-sales-forecasting). It contains sales transactions from three Walmart branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The dataset consists of 17 columns and 1000 rows, as detailed below:

## Analysis Overview

### 1. Product Analysis

- Analyze the data to understand product line performance, identifying which lines are most successful and which may need improvement.

### 2. Sales Analysis

- Explore sales trends for different products. This analysis will assess the effectiveness of current sales strategies and suggest improvements.

### 3. Customer Analysis

- Segment customers, examine purchase trends, and determine the profitability of different customer types.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Wrangling

This step involves inspecting the data to identify and address any missing or NULL values.

- **Step 1:** Create a database and load the data.
- **Step 2:** Select columns with NULL values. In this dataset, NULL values have been pre-filtered since all fields were set as **NOT NULL** when creating the database.

### 2. Feature Engineering

New columns will be created to derive additional insights from the existing data:

- **Time of Day:** A column that categorizes sales into Morning, Afternoon, and Evening to identify peak sales periods.
- **Day of Week:** A column that extracts the day of the week from the transaction date (Mon, Tue, Wed, etc.) to understand which days are the busiest.
- **Month of Year:** A column that extracts the month from the transaction date (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) to analyze sales trends over the year.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis will be performed to answer key business questions and meet project objectives.

### 4. Conclusion

The analysis will conclude with actionable insights and recommendations based on the data.

## Revenue and Profit Calculations

- **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold):** \( \text{COGS} = \text{unit price} \times \text{quantity} \)
- **VAT (Value Added Tax):** \( \text{VAT} = 5\% \times \text{COGS} \)
- **Total Sales:** \( \text{Total} = \text{COGS} + \text{VAT} \)
- **Gross Profit:** \( \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Total} - \text{COGS} \)
- **Gross Margin Percentage:** \( \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Total Sales}} \)

### Example Calculation

- **Unit Price:** $45.79
- **Quantity:** 7

1. **COGS:** \( 45.79 \times 7 = 320.53 \)
2. **VAT:** \( 5\% \times 320.53 = 16.03 \)
3. **Total:** \( 320.53 + 16.03 = 336.56 \)
4. **Gross Margin:** \( \frac{16.03}{336.56} = 0.0476 \approx 4.76\% \)
